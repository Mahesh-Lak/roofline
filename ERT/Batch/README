In this directory are a set of batch scripts for running the ERT on P100
GPUs in the Kingspeak CHPC cluster.

These scripts use the configurations in "../Config" and correspond to the
results in "../Results".

It is assumed that the batch script are submitted from the parent directory
of this directory so that all the paths are correct.  If submitted from
another directory, some changes will be needed.
