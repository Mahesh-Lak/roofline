In this directory are a set of ERT configuration scripts for running the
ERT on P100 GPUs in the Kingspeak CHPC cluster to obtain an empirical 
roofline measurement.

The goal of these configuration files is to obtain a good empirical
roofline measurement.  That said, these are only examples and it may be
possible to obtain better rooflines with different compiler/loader flags,
drivers/kernels, etc.

There are example batch scripts in "../Batch" and results from running these
configuration files in "../Results".
