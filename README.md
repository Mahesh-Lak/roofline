## Roofline Modeling and Performance Analysis on GPUs

Please refer to the detailed documentation for constructing roofline models at [tinyurl.com/CS6235roofline](https://tinyurl.com/CS6235roofline).

It has instructions to obtain the roofline ceilings (using ERT), the application characteristics (using nvprof), and running plotting scripts to visualize roofline models.

Please contact me at [maheshl@cs.utah.edu](maheshl@cs.utah.edu) if you have any issues in running ERT and the plotting scripts, and using nvprof for performance analysis, or if you have any feedback to improve the documentation and the code.
